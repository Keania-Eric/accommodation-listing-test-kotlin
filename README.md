Sure, here's a basic README file that explains how to run a Spring Boot Kotlin project using Docker Compose:

```markdown
# Spring Boot Kotlin Project with Docker Compose

This repository contains a Spring Boot Kotlin project that can be easily run using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. Build the Spring Boot project:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```


## Running with Docker Compose

1. Start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Access the application in your browser or using a tool like `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080
   ```

## Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop and remove the containers created by Docker Compose, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Additional Info

- I have other things I would have considered including pagination and cache and possibly a better of handling loading the objects into DTOs. Okay but I decided to use kotlin for this project and this was my first time of writing kotlin code.
